Insight Coding Challenge:
It is coded using IntelliJ IDEA, Ultimate 2019.2. The code starts with parsing the csv file provided so all data would be understanable for the computer for further analysis. Then conditional statements are passed through to fulfill the requirements as asked. They are also displayed on the scree. A "try and catch" is also added to prevent any unexpected crash.
